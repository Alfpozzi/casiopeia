Defining a system
=================

Since casiopeia uses CasADi, the user first has to define the considered system using CasADi symbolic variables (of type MX). Afterwards, the symbolic variables which define states, controls, parameters, etc. of the system can be brought into connection by creating a :class:`casiopeia.System` object.

.. automodule:: casiopeia.system
    :members:

This system object can now be used within the casiopeia simulation, parameter estimation and optimum experimental design classes.
