Get and install casiopeia
=========================

Within the next sections, you will get to know how to obtain and install casiopeia, and what prerequisites have to be met to get casiopeia working correctly.

Installation on Ubuntu 14.04
----------------------------

The following instructions show the installation on Ubuntu 14.04. If you are planning to install casiopeia on Linux systems different from Ubuntu 14.04, these commands need to be adapted accordingly.

Prerequesites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python
^^^^^^

In order to use casiopeia, please make sure that
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (currently supported version is Python 2.7) as well as
`Python Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ (>= 1.8), 
`PyLab <http://wiki.scipy.org/PyLab>`_ and `Python Setuptools <http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Python_setuptools>`_ are installed on your system. This can easily be ensured by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-setuptools --install-recommends

If you want to install casiopeia using `pip <https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/pip>`_, which is the recommended and easiest way, you also need to install pip by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

Also, you might want to install the `Spyder IDE <https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/>`_ for working with Python. You can install it by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install spyder

.. note:: These commands require root privileges. In case you do not have root privileges on your system, consider using `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html>`_ to install Python and the necessary modules into a user-writeable directory.

CasADi
^^^^^^

For casiopeia to work correctly, you need `CasADi <http://casadi.org>`_  version >= 3.x to be installed on your system. Installation instructions for CasADi can be found  `here <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions>`_.

.. note:: Some plugins for CasADi require extra prerequisites to work on Linux. For a list of the required libraries and installation instructions, see `the corresponding section in the CasADi installation guide <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/linuxplugins>`_. If something goes wrong with executing CasADi and/or casiopeia, missing one or more of these libraries might be the reason.

In addition to unpacking the archive you just obtained, please make sure that the unpacked folder that contains CasADi can be found by Python permanently. As mentioned in the CasADi installation instructions, this can e. g. be ensured by adding the CasADi directory to the :code:`PYTHONPATH` variable permanently. Just open the file :code:`~/.bashrc` on your system with your favorite text editor, and add the line

.. code:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path>/<to>/<casadi>/<folder>

while :code:`/<path>/<to>/<casadi>/<folder>` needs to be adapted to the path of your unpacked archive. Afterwards, save these changes and close all open terminals. Now open a new terminal, and have a look at the value of :code:`PYTHONPATH` by typing

.. code:: bash

    echo $PYTHONPATH

It should now contain at least the path your just inserted. If everything went well, you should be able to open a Python console, and execute the following commands

.. code::

    >>> from casadi import *
    >>> x = MX.sym("x")
    >>> print jacobian(sin(x),x)

without recieving error messages.

.. _option1:

Option 1: Get casiopeia using pip (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

casiopeia is listed on the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=casiopeia>`_. You can obtain it from there by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install casiopeia

If this command fails with a message that CasADi cannot be found on your system, and you installed CasADi by appending it's directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH` via :code:`~/.bashrc`, it's most likely that your users :code:`PYTHONPATH` variable is not available when using :code:`sudo`. In this case, try

.. code:: bash

    sudo env PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH pip install casiopeia

.. note:: These commands require root privileges. In case you do not have root privileges ony your system, consider :ref:`Option 2: Get casiopeia from GitHub <option2>`.

Upgrades
^^^^^^^^

Upgrades to new releases of casiopeia can simply be obtained by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install casiopeia --upgrade

or

.. code:: bash

    sudo env PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH pip install casiopeia --upgrade

respectively.


.. note:: These commands require root privileges.

.. _option2:

Option 2: Get casiopeia from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also obtain the casiopeia module `directly from its
GitHub repository <https://github.com/adbuerger/casiopeia>`_. You can either clone the repository, or download the contained files within a compressed archive. To just obtain an archive, you do not need to have `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ installed, but cloning the repository provides an easy way to receive updates on casiopeia by pulling from the repository.

You can install git by running

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git

.. note:: These commands require root privileges. In case you do not have root priviliges and git ist not installed on you system, consider downloading the archive from the `GitHub page <https://github.com/adbuerger/casiopeia>`_ using your favorite web browser instead of cloning the git repository.

Afterwards, you can clone the repository using the following commands

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:adbuerger/casiopeia.git

and install casiopeia by running

.. code:: bash
    
    sudo python setup.py install

from within the casiopeia directory. If this command fails with a message that CasADi cannot be found on your system, and you installed CasADi by appending it's directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH` via :code:`~/.bashrc`, it's most likely that your users :code:`PYTHONPATH` variable is not available when using :code:`sudo`. In this case, try

.. code:: bash

    sudo env PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH python setup.py install

.. note:: These commands require root privileges. In case you do not have root priviliges, consider adding the casiopeia directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH`, as described above for CasADi.

Upgrades
^^^^^^^^

If you recieved casiopeia by cloning the git repository, you can update the contents of your local copy by running

.. code:: bash
    
    git pull

from within the casiopeia directory. In case you did not clone the repository, you would again need to download a compressed archive.

Afterwards, you need to install the recent version again by running

.. code:: bash
    
    sudo python setup.py install

or

.. code::

    sudo env PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH python setup.py install

respectively.

.. note:: These commands require root privileges.

.. warning:: If you installed casiopeia by adding the directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH`, just place the newly obtained files in the previously defined path to upgrade to a new version of casiopeia. You do not not need to add the directory again to :code:`PYTHONPATH` then. Also, make sure not to add multiple versions of casiopeia to :code:`PYTHONPATH`, since this might lead to conflicts.


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

The following instructions have been tested on Windows 7 64 bit.

.. note:: You need to have administrator rights on your system to be able to follow the instructions below.

Prerequesites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python
^^^^^^

The easiest way to meet the prerequesites for casiopeia and CasADi on a Windows system might be to install a recent version of `Python(x,y) <http://python-xy.github.io/>`_, which is also the procedure recommended by the CasADi developers. It is recommended to do a "Full" installation. In the following, the instructions also assume that you are installing Python(x,y) and all components with their default paths.

CasADi
^^^^^^

For casiopeia to work correctly, you need `CasADi <http://casadi.org>`_  version >= 3.x to be installed on your system. Installation instructions for CasADi can be found  `here <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions>`_.

After unpacking the archive, go to :code:`My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables`. If a variable :code:`PYTHONPATH` already exists, apply the full path to the CasADi folder to the end of the variable value, and separate this new path from the ones already contained by :code:`;`. If :code:`PYTHONPATH` does not yet exist on the system, create a new environmental variable with this name, and fill in the path to the unpacked CasADi folder.

.. _option1win:

Option 1: Get casiopeia using pip (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

casiopeia is listed on the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=casiopeia&version=0.5&:action=display>`_. Since you installed `pip <https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/pip>`_ with Python(x,y), you can obtain casiopeia by opening a command line and running

.. code:: bash

    pip install casiopeia

.. note:: If you have problems obtaining casiopeia with pip (which can e. g. be caused by a company's proxy server) consider :ref:`Option 2: Get casiopeia from GitHub <option2win>`.

Upgrades
^^^^^^^^

Upgrades to new releases of casiopeia can simply be obtained by running

.. code:: bash

    pip install casiopeia --upgrade


.. _option2win:

Option 2: Get casiopeia from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also obtain the casiopeia module `directly from its
GitHub repository <https://github.com/adbuerger/casiopeia>`_. Since installing git is more time-consuming on Windows then it is on most Linux systems, it is recommended (at least for less experienced users) to just download the contained files for casiopeia within a compressed archive.

Afterwards, unpack the archive, and install casiopeia by running

.. code:: bash
    
    python setup.py install

from the command line, within the unzipped folder.

.. note:: If this procedure is for some reason not applicable for you, you can consider adding the casiopeia directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH` instead, as described above for CasADi.

Upgrades
^^^^^^^^

For upgrading casiopeia, you would again need to download a compressed archive.

Afterwards, you need to install the recent version by again running

.. code:: bash
    
    python setup.py install

.. warning:: If you installed casiopeia by adding the directory to :code:`PYTHONPATH`, just place the newly obtained files in the previously defined path to upgrade to a new version of casiopeia. You do not not need to add the directory again to :code:`PYTHONPATH` then. Also, make sure not to add multiple versions of casiopeia to :code:`PYTHONPATH`, since this might lead to conflicts.

Recommendations
---------------

To speed up computations in casiopeia, it is recommended to install `HSL for IPOPT <http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/>`_. On how to install the solvers and for further information, see the page `Obtaining HSL <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/Obtaining-HSL>`_ in the CasADi wiki.
